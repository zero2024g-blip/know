# Deploying the patched files

## 1. Back up first
Keep your current copy. Every change here is reversible by restoring it.

## 1b. PHP version — read this before anything else

**Run PHP 8.3. Not 8.4, not 8.5, and not 7.4 either.**

This is not a preference, it is a hard incompatibility, and I reproduced it
against your own code:

    PHP 8.4 : POST /login -> 500
              Fatal error: Declaration of CodeIgniter\I18n\Time::createFromTimestamp(...)
              must be compatible with DateTime::createFromTimestamp(int|float $timestamp)
    PHP 8.3 : login OK, /dashboard OK, /keys OK, /admin/manage-users OK, zero errors

PHP 8.4 added a native `DateTime::createFromTimestamp()`. CodeIgniter 4.1.5
(what this project ships, released Sept 2021) declares its own method of the
same name with a different signature on a class that extends `DateTime`. PHP
refuses to load the class at all — and production mode cannot hide a fatal.

That is exactly the "some things crash" you saw: only the pages that touch
`Time` die. Login is one of them, which is why it looked random.

7.4 is the other end of the problem: it has had no security patches since
November 2022. 8.3 is supported and is the newest version this framework
version can run.

To actually reach 8.4/8.5 the framework has to be upgraded — 4.7.4 is current
and requires PHP ^8.2. That is a real migration (config layout, Time, model
events all changed between 4.1 and 4.7), not a version bump. Worth planning;
not worth doing in a hurry.

## 2. Delete these — they are removed, not replaced
    app/BACKUP/                  # stale view copies, still held the old secret
    public/default.php           # Hostinger's placeholder page
    public/default.php.old.php   # dead page in the webroot

`default.php` is Hostinger's own "your site is installed" placeholder. It is
not a security hole — it contains no secrets and no logic beyond `date('Y')`.
The page itself says: *"Please delete the file default.php from the
public_html folder."* Two reasons to do as it asks: it names your hosting
provider to anyone who requests it, and if your DirectoryIndex order ever
changes, visitors get "site not yet uploaded" instead of your panel.

## 3. Upload the zip over your install
Paths inside the zip mirror your project root. `public/assets/vendor/`
is new — 912 KB of self-hosted Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons, jQuery,
SweetAlert2 and Poppins.

## 4. Edit .env by hand — I could not, I deleted my copy

    # was: g████████  (8 lowercase letters)
    encryption.key = hex2bin:<run `php spark key:generate`>

    # was: 2592000 (30 days)
    app.sessionExpiration = 604800
    cookie.expires        = 604800

Also rotate `database.default.password` — it was in the archive you sent.

## 4b. The encryption key is now blank on purpose

`app/Config/Encryption.php` used to carry a real 64-hex key as a literal.
A key committed to source travels with every copy of the code and cannot
be rotated per install, and this project shipped `app/BACKUP/` inside the
webroot. It is now `''`, and the value comes from `.env` only.

No app code calls the encrypter today, so nothing breaks either way — but
set it anyway, because CI4 needs it the moment you start using sessions
that encrypt, or `encrypt()`/`decrypt()`:

    encryption.key = hex2bin:<run `php spark key:generate`>

## 4c. New look — what changed and how to undo it

The 31 KB `<style>` block that used to sit inside `Layout/Starter.php` is now
two files: `public/assets/css/theme.css` (the previous look, unchanged) and
`public/assets/css/ember.css` (the new layer on top). Everything else about
the panel behaves as it did.

Measured over a six-page session, this cuts what is transferred by **51%**
(80.5 KB -> 39.8 KB), because the CSS is now fetched once and cached instead
of travelling inside every page. That is the change that matters most on a
slow connection.

To go back to the old appearance, delete one line from `Layout/Starter.php`:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= asset_ver('assets/css/ember.css') ?>">

Asset URLs now carry `?v=<mtime>` via the new `asset_ver()` helper. This is
required, not cosmetic: `.htaccess` serves CSS and JS with `max-age=31536000,
immutable`, so without a version in the URL a returning visitor would keep a
stale stylesheet for a year.

**If you add a `bi-*` icon to any view, run `tools/subset-icons.sh`.** The
icon font is subsetted to only the icons in use; a new one renders as a blank
box until you rebuild it.

## 5. Check it works
- Sign in. Sign out. Sign in again.
- Open Keys. The table loads and the page is noticeably faster.
- Reset a key's devices. Then reset a second one **without reloading** —
  this proves the CSRF token rotation is handled.
- As a non-admin, open /admin/manage-users. You must be bounced.
- Register with a referral code. Then try the **same code again** — it
  must be refused. Before this patch it stayed usable forever.
- Change your own password, sign out, sign back in with the new one.
  Do it for a legacy account too, if you still have one.
- On the dashboard as a **reseller**: the four counters and the activity list
  must show only your own keys. As admin they cover everyone.
- On a phone, open Keys. The reset and edit buttons must be reachable without
  sideways scrolling, and each key must show its expiry underneath it.
- Reset a key's devices. The "Please wait…" toast must appear — if it does
  not, `Toast` is undefined and the script order regressed.

## Not done — needs a decision from you
- **CSP.** Views contain inline `<script>`. Enabling CSP means adding a
  nonce to each block first, or the panel stops working.
- **Legacy password hashes.** Rehash-on-login is already in place, but
  idle accounts keep the old scheme. Find them with:

      SELECT id_users, username FROM users WHERE password LIKE '$2y$08$%';

  then force a reset on those, and delete `create_password()`.
- **Connect.php** was empty in the archive. It is exempt from CSRF *and*
  auth, so it is the most exposed route in the app and still unreviewed.
